This can be useful, for example, when you need to perform an action on all classes that implement a specific interface. Alternatively, if you have a list of classes you want to load, you can use a loop to load each individual class using Class.forName(), and store the classes in a collection for later use.

      "To handle such issues, it is advisable to use a pattern that enables the `split()` method to generate the expected outcome. One way to do this is to use regular expressions to specify the delimiter, which provides more flexibility in determining the separator between the String elements. Additionally, it is important to check the return value of the `split()` method to ensure that it has captured the intended segments.\n",
